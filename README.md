# Minute Mind - A time tracking application was designed and created with the goal of allowing its users to manage, record as well as to view the allocated time that teams of software developers spend on client-issued projects.

Description ~ This application created for users to sign-up/login to a account, and the saving of timesheet entries is done using a Firebase authentication medium. Once an authorized user is logged in to use the application, they will be allowed to enter timesheet entries to specify the categories as well as the hours worked on each user project, which can be displayed and documented to the user. We as the MinuteMind software development creation team designed this application by using the installed features which consisted of Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.1.1 (Jan 2023) as well as the in-built Android Studio emulator (the user must select API 25 as the device for the application to be compatible with the chosen emulator as conflicting choice of device selection may not execute the project) using the Kotlin coding language, which is required by the Varsity College (Durban-North campus) to be used to successfully complete this project. 

How to Install and Run the Project:
Android Studio Project Code ~
Step 1  
        * Ensure that oneâ€™s computer has the capabilities to operate Android Studio
   * Ensure one has the necessary space to download the application.
   * Check the required necessary system requirements

Step 3  
        * View and carefully read and identify the terms and conditions of installing Android Studio. 
Step 4 
        * Start coding and have FUN!!! ðŸ˜Š
Step 5  
        * Download project code from GitHub by searching for our GitHub repository link
Step 6  
        * Open Android Studio, click on open project, and navigate to the folder which contains developed code
        * You have now accessed our MinuteMind Anroid Studio.
Step 7  
        * Navigate to Google (using any browsing platform such as Google Chrome) and search for the Firebase Console in order to find the user credientials saved as well as to view the realtime database to view our stored timesheet entry pages as well as the Firebase storage collection to view the stored images.

# Changes made:
 - The team added a photo to the recycleView and tried to implement a optional photo choice.
 - The team improved upon the design to make it more consistant and user-freindly.
 - The team made sure not to show the Firebase databse in the demo video.

# Application features
(Version 2.0)
 - When creating an account through the sign up, the application allows users to input an appropriate email and password. These authorization details will be saved to the Firebase authentication medium. And once a user is successfully signed in they may click on the login button to use the application. Once the user has successfully logged into the application, the process of operating the application is as follows:
 
 ~ A user will be transferred to the MinuteMind dashboard where the user will view eight different buttons (Home Page, Timesheet, View Entry, Profile, Proof, Graph, Settings and Logout). 

 ~ The process of the user selecting each button and the outcomes are as follows:

Dashboard Features:
___________________

- HomePage button: Will show the Home Page.

- Timesheet button: Will be transferred to the timesheet page, where they may willingly add a new timesheet entry to the application by specifying the name they would like to save the timesheet as, the category they wish to classify the entry as (e.g. regular working hours or overtime) the date to wish the timesheet entry was issued, the start time and completion time that this entry will be valid for, as well as the description of the entry. Once the process is completed, the user will be prompted to select three different button options namely; to "Save" the timesheet entry, go to "Homepage" or to view the entries.
      1) If the user selects to "Save" the timesheet entry they created by selecting the button prompt, they will receive an in-built, hard-coded message by the MinuteMind team that will inform the user that their timesheet information was saved successfully to the system.
          2) If the user clicks on the Home Page button from the Timesheet entry page, they will return to the main Dashboard.
           3) View Entry button: Will be able to view all timesheet entries created through the use of an android recyclerview functionality.

~ View Entry button: Will be able to view all timesheet entries created through the use of an android recyclerview functionality.

~ Profile button: Will be transferred to the profile page to view their profile format.

~ Proof button: Will be transferred to the proof page to display in a visual format how well the user is doing with staying between their minimum and maximum hour goals over the past month.

~ Graph button: Will be transferred to the graph page to view the graph showing the total hours worked each day over a user selectable period.

~ Settings button: Will be transferred to the settings page, where user preferences will be displayed to allow the user to enable the dark-mode theme to be applied through the all pages across the application.

~ Logout button: Will logout the user and move the user back to the registration page.

2 Extra Features:
___________________

1) We added a splash scream, so when the user logs on, they'll see our icon loading.
2) We added darkmode as a feature, and it was succesfully implemented througout the app.

An app icon and image assets have been added to the final design.
